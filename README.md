This was an individual project.

### How I worked on this project

My goal was to showcase data transformation.

### How to navigate this project

- Use of useEffect and useState for a dynamic application: [Example code](src/App.js)
- Use of custom and responsive CSS: [Example code](src/Main.css)
- The application fetches data from OpenWeather API: Example for the [request](src/weatherService.js)

### Why I built the project this way

- Use of custom css makes the web application responsive

### If I had more time I would change this

- I would refactor this [portion](src/components/Details.js) of the code whereby I have to put in the details of the cards as it could very much get out of hand if I have more cards.
